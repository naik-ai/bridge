# Frontend Agent - Next.js + Design System + SSE

You are a senior frontend engineer. Implement the FRONTEND according to the PDR below (paste after <<<PDR>>>). Build a production-ready MVP that meets all acceptance criteria. Generate a runnable monorepo segment with code, configs, tests, and docs.

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Use a multi-file patch style: for each file, show a path line like: `// path: apps/web/<file>` then the file contents.
- Include a concise `README.md` with setup/run instructions.
- Include `.env.sample` (no secrets), `Dockerfile`, and CI pipeline for the web app.

SCOPE & REQUIREMENTS (implement exactly)
- Framework: **Next.js (App Router)** with **TypeScript**.
- UI kit: **ShadCN/UI** (buttons, cards, tabs, dialogs, toasts, dropdowns); dark/light theme.
- Charts: **Recharts**; encapsulate charts in reusable components that accept compact payloads from backend.
- Architecture:
  - App shell (VS Code-like): 
    - Left **Explorer** (dashboards list + datasets placeholder),
    - Center **Workspace Tabs** (Dashboard View, Chart Builder, YAML Editor),
    - Right **Assistant Panel** (LLM chat UI; stubs only—no provider integration needed).
- YAML ↔ UI:
  - Load YAML via backend (`/dashboards/compile`/`save`) and render via a **YAML→UI mapper** (grid + widgets).
  - Two-way edits: e.g., color picker, title changes → update in-memory model; write back on **explicit Save** (no autosave in MVP).
  - Show dirty state and “Saved • <timestamp>”.
- Data layer:
  - Never query BigQuery directly. Fetch only from backend (`/data/{slug}`, `/sql/run` preview limited rows).
  - In-memory store (Zustand or Context) for active dashboard, dirty flag, and last save time; clear on route change unless saved.
- Freshness UX:
  - Per-card “As of <timestamp> • Source <mv/partition>”.
  - Global banner area reserved for “New data available” (triggered by version param when present; Phase 1 ready).
- Lineage UI:
  - Read-only expandable graph view powered by `/lineage/{slug}`; node details drawer; “Explain in chat” button wiring.
- Auth:
  - Integrate **Google SSO** (front-channel) consistent with backend; protect routes; display signed-in user, sign-out.
- Errors & empty states:
  - Friendly errors with trace id from backend; retry and “copy details”.
  - Empty dashboard CTA: “Start in Chat” or “Import YAML”.
- Testing:
  - Component tests (React Testing Library) for renderer + chart wrappers.
  - E2E tests (Playwright) for: sign-in stub, load dashboard, edit color, Save, refresh page → persisted change visible.
- Performance:
  - Avoid unnecessary re-renders; memoize chart wrappers.
  - Lighthouse performance budget noted in README.
- CI:
  - GitHub Actions (or Cloud Build YAML) to run lint, typecheck, tests, and build the Next.js image for `apps/web`.
- Docs:
  - `README.md` covering: dev setup, envs, how YAML→UI mapping works, how to add new widget types, and how Save/dirty state behaves.

ACCEPTANCE (must pass)
- App runs locally (Docker). Google SSO flow completes against backend gating (stub acceptable for local).
- Load sample dashboard from backend; renderer displays charts (Recharts) and “As of …” text per card.
- Edit a chart color via UI; **Save** writes back; reload page → change persists (YAML round-trip).
- Open Lineage view for the dashboard; graph renders; node details drawer shows query/table info.
- E2E test automates the above flow successfully.
